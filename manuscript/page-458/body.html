Really, madam, you don't seem able to get rid of your caprices here."</p><p>"Then why did you come and lie down here?"</p><p>"They put me here, my wife and little children put me here, I did not lie down here of myself. The mystery of death! And I would not have lain down beside you not for any money; I lie here as befitting my fortune, judging by the price. For we can always do that—pay for a tomb of the third grade."</p><p>"You made money, I suppose? You fleeced people?"</p><p>"Fleece you, indeed! We haven't seen the colour of your money since January. There's a little bill against you at the shop."</p><p>"Well, that's really stupid; to try and recover debts here is too stupid, to my thinking! Go to the surface. Ask my niece—she is my heiress."</p></div> </div>
