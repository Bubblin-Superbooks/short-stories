I recognise her voice; I understand it all now, this is not she!" said the gentleman in raccoon, turning as white as a sheet.</p><p>"Hush!"</p><p>The young man leaned against the wall.</p><p>"My dear sir, I am off. It is not she, I am glad to say."</p><p>"All right! Be off, then!"</p><p>"Why are you staying, then?"</p><p>"What's that to you?"</p><p>The door opened, and the gentleman in raccoon could not refrain from dashing headlong downstairs.</p><p>A man and a woman walked by the young man, and his heart stood still.... He heard a familiar feminine voice and then a husky male voice, utterly unfamiliar.</p><p>"Never mind, I will order the sledge," said the husky voice.</p></div> </div>
