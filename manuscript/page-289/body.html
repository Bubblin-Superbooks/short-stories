"For God's sake, do move a little."</p><p>"I really don't know what is the matter with you; can't you lie still?..."</p><p>"You are exasperated against me, young man, you want to wound me, I see that.

If we are discovered I am not to blame in any way; I know nothing about it."</p><p>"If you don't hold your tongue," said the young man, grinding his teeth, "I will say that you brought me here. I'll say that you are my uncle who has dissipated his fortune. Then they won't imagine I am this lady's lover, anyway."</p><p>"Sir, you are amusing yourself at my expense. You are exhausting my patience."</p></div> </div>
