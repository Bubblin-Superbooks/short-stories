For three days at a time he says nothing, and then he bursts out with 'I should like a taste of life, yes, a taste of life!' And with such appetite, he-he!"</p><p>"And such frivolity."</p><p>"It gets hold of him, your Excellency, and do you know, he is growing sleepy, quite sleepyâ€”he has been here since April; and then all of a sudden 'I should like a taste of life!'"</p><p>"It is rather dull, though," observed his Excellency.</p><p>"It is, your Excellency.
